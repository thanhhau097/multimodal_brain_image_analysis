Thanks for your interest in the MICCAI BraTS 2019 dataset (https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2019.html)

Your IPP account has been successfully registered for the BraTS 2019 challenge.

You can download the complete training data, including ground truth segmentation labels and survival data, from:
https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/Spyridon.Bakas/MICCAI_BraTS/2019/MICCAI_BraTS_2019_Data_Training.zip

You can now also download the independent set of validation scans (without ground truth labels) from:
https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/Spyridon.Bakas/MICCAI_BraTS/2019/MICCAI_BraTS_2019_Data_Validation.zip 

INSTRUCTIONS ON USING THE EVALUATION APPLICATIONS: 
-------------------------------------------------- 
The evaluation applications available in CBICA's IPP relate to the 1) Segmentation Task and 2) Survival Task.

For the "Segmentation Task", note that the segmentations you upload in the evaluation applications must be named using only the subject ID and the extension .nii.gz. The subject ID is given by the folder name containing the 4 modality images for each subject. In other words, for a subject with folder name "ID", which contains images ID_t1.nii.gz, ID_t2.nii.gz, etc., the segmentation file should be named ID.nii.gz 

For the "Survival Task", the predicted survival data should be in a .csv file that has the subject ID in column 1 and the predicted survival values in days in column 2. The .csv should NOT contain ANY HEADER. 

Please note that uploaded files for both tasks will be kept by the IPP for future reference and evaluation within the scope of the BraTS challenge.

Once your uploaded data are evaluated, you will receive an email pointing to a separate Results.zip file for each of the tasks, accessible via the IPP. Please note that there is a limit of concurrent evaluations that you can run, and a limit on the evaluations that you can have stored in the portal (n=10). Please make sure that you delete evaluations once you receive their results. 

Finally, please make sure that whenever you use and/or refer to the BraTS datasets in your manuscripts, you should always cite the papers mentioned at: https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2019/data.html 

Please contact brats2019@cbica.upenn.edu with any questions you may have.
